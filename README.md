# CS50P – Introduction to Programming with Python 🐍

This repository contains my solutions and projects for **CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python (CS50P)** by Harvard University.

The course focuses on building strong programming fundamentals using Python, covering topics such as conditionals, loops, exceptions, file I/O, regular expressions, testing, and object-oriented programming.

---

## 📚 Course Overview

CS50P teaches how to:
- Think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable Python code
- Use Python libraries and modules
- Handle errors and edge cases
- Test code using unit tests
- Work with files, CSVs, images, and PDFs
- Apply regular expressions
- Design object-oriented programs

## 🗂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by **course weeks**, matching the official CS50P curriculum:

```txt
cs50-python/
├── 0_Functions_and_Variables

├── 2_Loops
├── 3_Exceptions
├── 4_Libraries
├── 5_Unit_Tests
├── 6_File_IO
├── 7_Regular_Expressions
├── 8_Object_Oriented_Programming
└── project
```


Each folder contains the problem sets for that week, with each problem in its own subdirectory.
